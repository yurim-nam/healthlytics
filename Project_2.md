# Project 2: Depression EEG Analysis

This project is an exploration and attempt to analyze EEG waves based on the different frequency waves and find whether there is a distinct difference between patients with and without depression.

## Main Objectives 
---
1. **Frequency Wave categorization**
> “Can we categorize EEG bands by their frequencies?"
2. **Comparsion of bands between MDD vs HC (Healthy Control) Patients**
> “Can we see a stiatistically significant difference in band importance bewteen MDD and HC patients?”

## Methods
---
- MNE Python for EEG analysis 
- Matplotlib for plotting information
