# Health Data Analysis Portfolio
Exploring patient data through R and Python, clustering, and interactive dashboards.

This repository showcases projects in biomedical and clinical data analysis. 
It includes patient clustering, exploratory visualizations, and interactive dashboards built with R (Shiny) and Python. 
The goal is to uncover patterns in clinical outcomes and make complex data easier to explore.

## Projects

- **PANSS Patient Clustering**: Clustering schizophrenia patients based on symptom scales and visualizing patterns with an interactive Shiny dashboard.
